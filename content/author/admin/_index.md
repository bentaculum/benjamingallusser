I am currently a PhD student in [Martin Weigert's group](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/weigert-lab/) at EPFL in Switzerland, where I develop machine-learning-based methods for analysing microscopy images of the building blocks of life.

Proteins, organelles, cells, tissues or even entire animals; to learn about them we can often simply take a (sophisticated) picture or video. And after that we need to extract quantitative information from our recordings!

While supervised deep learning is enjoying a lot of success for processing bioimages, it is often limited by a lack of appropriate ground truth annotations. How can we incorporate uncurated images fresh off the microscope into training neural networks?

If you are excited about this as well please [reach out](mailto:benjamin.gallusser@protonmail.com) :)

Previously, I have worked on automating cell organelle segmentation in electron microscopy data in [Tom Kirchhausen's lab](https://kirchhausen.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School, as well as on 3D neuron reconstruction from electron microscopy in [Jan Funke's group](https://www.janelia.org/lab/funke-lab/) at HHMI Janelia.
